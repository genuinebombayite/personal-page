            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Happily married with two grown children! I am a technology executive who did a PhD in Physics and have been heavily involved in the medical device industry with focus on software and increasingly the use of AI in HealthCare. I currently work as VP of Software Engineering & Advanced Technology at Proprio Inc which is developing an image guided surgical navigation system. I was born in New Delhi, India but spent most of my formative years in Bombay. I moved to the US in 1988, first to go to graduate school to get my PhD but I always intended to eventually live here and that is what I did. I currently live with my wife in the beautiful neighborhood of Fells Point in Baltimore, MD.</p>
